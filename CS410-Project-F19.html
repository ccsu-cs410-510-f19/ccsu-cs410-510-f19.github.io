	<p>CS 410 - Software Engineering Course Project - Fall 2019</p></div>

	<p>Objective: design and implement a complex software system utilizing the skills acquired in this course</p>



	<div class="Underhead">
	<p><b>Project phases, deliverables, and due dates</b></p></div>
	<p>This project must be completed by teams of three or four students using
	an agile process model.</p>
	<p>Each deliverable must be submitted on or before the indicated
	due date. Teams will not be allowed to proceed to a subsequent project
	phase without submitting a satisfactory deliverable for the previous
	phase.</p>
	<p>Each deliverable document must have a title page indicating the
	project title, deliverable name, team name and membership, and submission
	date.</p>
	<p>The following will always be considered when grading your work in this course:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><b>Presentation</b>: the report is well formatted, easy to read, and easy to navigate;</li>
	  <li><b>Quality of writing</b>: language, grammar, clarity, professionalism;</li>
	  <li><b>Consistency</b>: all required points are addressed in the same order as listed in each section below.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Submit an informal essay (PDF, 2 pages max) describing the following:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Intended use of the system: who and how will use the system. (4 pts)</li>
	  <li>Its overall functionality: what will the system do, how will the system help its users accomplish their tasks. (3 pts)</li>
	  <li>Main components of the system: break down the system into logical or architectural components and provide the rationale for this breakdown. (3 pts)</li>
	</ul>




	<div class="Underhead">
	<p><b><a id="System_requirements_document">System requirements (10 pts, due 10/4/18)</a></b></p></div>
	<p>Submit a system requirements document (PDF with a UML use case diagram, no page limit) as described below:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Begin with a narrative to give a general overview of the system's <i>functional</i> requirements.
		Provide one big <a href="https://cs.ccsu.edu/~stan/classes/CS410/notes16/04-Requirements.html#usecasediagrams">use case diagram</a> illustrating the overall functionality of the system.
		Describe each use case in an easy to understand natural language. (2 pts)</li>

		<li>Using the use case diagram as a starting point, convert each use case into a user story. Organize your user stories as a numbered list. (2 pts)<br>
		A typical format of the user story is as follows: As a <i>user role</i>, I want <i>goal</i> so that <i>reason</i>:
		  <ul>
			  <li>The <i>user role</i> represents an actor or a developer who benefits from this story;</li>
			  <li>The <i>goal</i> of the story is a feature or function in the system, a tool, or a part of a production pipeline;</li>
			  <li>The <i>reason</i> describes the benefit to the customer or user when this feature or function is used.</li>
		  </ul>

		</li><li>For each user story, provide a set of pre- and post-conditions (refer to each corresponding user story by their numbers). Note: list pre- and post-conditions under the corresponding user story. Note: there should be a single list of user stories in your document. (2 pts)</li>
		<li>Are there any user stories that are too big or complex? Can some of them be decomposed into smaller user stories? For each user story, mention whether or not it may need to be broken down (this will be done later). (1 pt)</li>
		<li>Provide a separate list of any relevant <i>nonfunctional</i> requirements. (1 pt)</li>
		<li>Include a <i>glossary</i> that defines all relevant terms that may have
		a special meaning in the context of the system. (2 pts)</li>

	  Use Fibonacci numbers to represent a relative size of each user story.
	  Note the cumulative size of all user stories in your product backlog. (2 pts)</li>
	  <li>Provide an updated numbered list of all user stories; indicate pre- and post-conditions. (1 pt)</li>
	  <li>Taking into account the pre- and post-conditions, identify a subset of user stories to be implemented during the first iteration (there will be a total of three iterations).

	  <li>What are the "lessons learned" at the end of this iteration? What would you do differently next time? Explain. (2 pt)</li>
	  <li>Provide an updated numbered list of all user stories yet to be implemented; indicate pre- and post-conditions. (1 pt)</li>
	  <li>(2 pts)
	     <ul>
	        <li>If this is not the last iteration:<br>
		        Given the current functionality of the system and taking into account the pre- and post-conditions, identify a subset of user stories to be implemented during the next iteration. Be sure that the cumulative size of the selected user stories is about 1/3 of the size of the full backlog. Describe the functionality that your (partially implemented) system will have at the end of this iteration.</li>
		     <li>If this is the last iteration:<br>
			     Are there any user stories left unimplemented in the backlog? Are there any new user stories that you would consider adding to the backlog. List these user stories and explain them.</li>

	<p>All deliverables will be graded as a result of work of the entire
	team. However, individual students may receive different grades
	based on the degree and quality of their involvement in the project.
	To facilitate the objectivity in grading, each student will be required
	to complete a confidential survey about the involvement of other
	members of his or her team in the project. These surveys will be
	strictly confidential. Students who fail to complete this survey
	will receive a grade of 0 for the entire course project. </p>

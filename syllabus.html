<dl>
<dt>Participation and in class work:</dt>
<dd>We will be doing a lot of in class work which is critical to your understanding of the material and drives the entire class' learning.  As a result I take your effort in it very seriously. Participating does not simply mean showing up for class. It means fully engaging and contributing to the class discussion.  A detailed explanation that applies both to lectures as well as in-class work can be found at <a href="http://www.cs.ccsu.edu/~williams/classes/WhatDoesClassParticipationMean.pdf">http://www.cs.ccsu.edu/~williams/classes/WhatDoesClassParticipationMean.pdf</a>.</dd>

<dd>Finally, I know you are very bright otherwise you wouldn't be here, and I value your ideas and contributions in making this class better. Because I believe your active participation makes the class a better learning experience for all, I appreciate your questions anytime you don't fully understand something or questions on how the material might be applied in practice. I do not expect you to know all of the answers. Thoughtful participation regardless of correctness will be rewarded.</dd>

<dt>Exams:</dt>
<dd>There will be two tests and a final exam. Each test will focus on the most recent material. However, each test will very likely include some questions aimed at the material covered by the earlier test(s). Make-up tests may only be given if a student can provide a written proof of a serious reason for missing a test (such as illness or accident).</dd>

<dt>Hands-on case studies:</dt>
<dd>Each case study will present students with a realistic problem or a plausible situation within a software development project. Working individually, in pairs, or in small teams, students will identify one or several solutions to the presented problem. Students will receive points for a case study only if they attend and participate in both the case study and its debrief session. No make ups will be available for missed case studies.</dd>

<dt>Course project:</dt>
<dd> While working on the course project, students will use the knowledge and skills obtained in this course covering many if not all of the course topics. Working in teams, students will design, implement and document a software system to meet the requirements of an external customer.</dd>

<dt>Attendance:</dt>
<dd>I expect students to attend class sessions regularly. ***For each absence (unless university excused) over 3 your overall final grade will be reduced by 1/4th of a letter grade. Skipping classes can seriously affect your final grade!*** If you are going to miss class please email me before class. Each student is responsible for making-up any missed study or work on their own. Limited assistance will be offered to those with plausible reasons for absences; unexcused absences result in the student being totally responsible for the make-up process. You are responsible for all announcements and material covered in the event that you do miss class, and should get that information from one of your classmates. In the event of a weather emergency that requires curtailment or cancellation of classes, listen to WTIC (1080 AM) or call (860) 832-3333.</dd>

<dt>Academic Honesty:</dt>
<dd> Students are expected to practice the highest standards of ethics, honesty and integrity in all of their academic work. Any form of academic dishonesty (e.g., plagiarism, cheating and misrepresentation) may result in disciplinary action. Possible disciplinary actions may include failure for part of or all of a course as well as suspension from the University. I absolutely require that you fulfill your academic obligations in a fair and honest manner. This includes turning in work that is uniquely yours, unless I explicitly require you to work on a project in a group. I strongly suggest that if you work with others, you only work together in the idea generation phase. When it comes to writing your work, you must do so independently. It is in your best interest to never look at any assignments written by another student and to never let another student see any assignments you have written. If you do turn in work that I suspect is the result of cheating, it will be dealt with **harshly**. You may find the full Academic Misconduct Policy online at:

http://www.ccsu.edu/academicintegrity/

 Please read it carefully.
</dd>
<dt>Students with disabilities:</dt>
<dd>Central Connecticut State University provides reasonable accommodations in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act for students with documented disabilities on an individualized basis.  If you are a student with a documented disability, and would like to request academic accommodations, you are encouraged to contact Student Disability Services (SDS) at 860-832-1952, or email disabilityservices@ccsu.edu . Please visit the SDS website at http://www.ccsu.edu/sds/ to download an Intake form and documentation requirements. Once approved, SDS suggests that students discuss their approved accommodations with their professors, as well as any other additional medical emergency needs. Temporary impairments may also qualify for accommodations. Please note that accommodations are not retroactive and must be requested each semester.
</dd>

<dt>Statement on Discrimination and Harassment:</dt>
<dd>Central Connecticut State University strives to maintain our campus as a place of work and study for faculty, staff, and students that is free of all forms of prohibited discrimination and harassment based upon age; ancestry, color; gender identity and expression; intellectual disability; learning disability; mental disorder; physical disability; marital status, national origin; race; religious creed; sex, (including
pregnancy, transgender status, sexual harassment and sexual assault); sexual orientation; or any other status protected by federal or state laws.  Any student who has concerns should contact the Office of Diversity and Equity (ODE) at 860-832-1652, Student Affairs at 860-832-1601, or his/her faculty member.  The ODE is located on the main floor of Davidson Hall, room 102.</dd>

<dt>Sexual Misconduct, Intimate Partner Violence and Stalking</dt>
<dd> Central Connecticut State University (CCSU) will not tolerate sexual misconduct against students, staff, faculty, or visitors in any form, including but not limited to: sexual assault, sexual exploitation, sexual
harassment or stalking, as defined in CCSU policies.  For additional information, please consult the CCSU policy at http://www.ccsu.edu/ctfd/files/UniversityPolicySyllabi_website.pdf.  All faculty members and staff have a duty to report incidents of sexual harassment including sexual misconduct, intimate partner violence and stalking to Rosa Rodríguez, Title IX Officer, Office of Diversity and
Equity, Davidson Hall, 102.  To file a report contact: Diversity and Equity (860-832-1652), Student Conduct (860-832-1667) or Student Affairs (860-832-1601). For criminal complaints, contact the University Police (860-832-2375).  For support and advocacy contact:  Office of Victim Advocacy at 860-832-3795 or sarahdodd@ccsu.edu; Student Wellness Services at 860-832-1945 (confidential); Women's Center at 860-832-1655; the local YWCA's Sexual Assault Crisis Services Hotline at 860-223-1787 (confidential) and Prudence Crandall Center for Domestic Violence (confidential) at 888-774-2900 (24-hour hotline).
